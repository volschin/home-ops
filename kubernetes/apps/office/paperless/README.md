# `paperless`

## Introduction

> A community-supported supercharged version of paperless: scan, index and archive all your physical documents.

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper â€“ although I still keep almost all documents in paper form.

Some of it's features are:

- Performs OCR on your documents, adds selectable text to image only documents and adds tags, correspondents and document types to your documents.
- Full text search helps you find what you need.
- Email processing: Paperless adds documents from your email accounts.
- Machine learning powered document matching.
- [More features can be found on their GitHub repository](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#features)
